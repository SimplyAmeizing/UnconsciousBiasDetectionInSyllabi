CSCE 310 Syllabus – Summer 2022 – Wade 6 | Page  Although the group project has a higher weight, other components with lower weights do contribute to a higher letter grade
 We do not curve in this class; 89.9
is still considered a B
Rather, we teach to proficiency, setting clear expectations of what you need to accomplish to earn an A
If he is participating in class or the group project, and making adjustments based on our feedback, he should expect an A with just fulfilling the basic requirements
To ensure inclusiveness and avoid exclusion of students, he will be assigned to a project group based on results of a skill survey to ensure that technical experience is balanced across the different project groups
Any additional items added later to the rubric count as extra credit, hence there is no obligation to comply with the requirement; you can still get an A fulfilling the basic requirements
o Final code (that is clean and understandable), submitted in the assigned GitHub Classroom repository, and any other supporting documentation (e.g.
README, code comments, etc.)
● Condition of getting the project group grade is submission of all peer feedback and completion of all project deliverables by the deadline specified in Canvas
 His overall grade can increase, even up a letter grade, based on (but not limited to) the following: o Excellent project deliverables, exceeding basic expectations
 His overall grade can decrease, even down a letter grade, based on (but not limited to) the following: o Project deliverables with high severity defects (i.e.
This can be due to poor peer feedback (verified) [or] interactions with the teaching team
o Continuously missing your group’s meetings, based on feedback from your fellow team members
o Inappropriate (e.g.
assigned reading), to let us know where his knowledge might be lacking for us to make continuous class improvements
Once he has taken the exam / quiz, he is not allowed to talk about its composition with anyone
In addition, exams / quizzes are required to be taken in a scheduled, synchronous online proctored environment, otherwise, taking the exam outside of the proctored environment can constitute academic misconduct
Homework  These are expected to be completed individually, as his understanding of homework questions will maximize your grade in exams / quizzes, which in part will be based on the homework
Any violation of academic integrity constitutes academic misconduct and will be reported to the honors council and result in the application of an appropriate sanction
 Homework must be submitted electronically using Canvas, and will be due 11:59 p.m
of the due date, unless otherwise noted
Incorrect submission or technology-related / technological problems are not valid excuses for late or missed work
Late Work Policy With pre-approval from the instructor, late submissions (e.g.
submitting after the deadline, submitting after the last day of class) is accepted only up to the time that the solutions will be discussed in class or as agreed to with the instructor
The request for deadline extensions should be submitted at least two business days (not counting weekends) before the due date (e.g.
if the due date is Monday, request has to be received by Thursday), by sending a request via a link to be given by the instructor, especially for those absences that meet Student Rule 7
*The only exception is in the case of an emergency; in which case you can submit the request for extension when able
“Unapproved” late assignments will receive a grade of zero
To be eligible for extra credit points, he needs to have a maximum of two missed or late deliverables, (e.g.
homework, project, etc.)
not counting those that have been excused; and his latest peer feedback has at least a ‘meets expectations’ average score
The instructor will consider the circumstances before approving extra credit based on factors such as visible effort in the class and contribution to the group project, or if it makes a difference in increasing his grade to the next level
