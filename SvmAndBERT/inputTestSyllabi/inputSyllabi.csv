64,,, We do not curve in this class; 89.9
65,,,is still considered a B
66,,,"Rather, we teach to proficiency, setting clear expectations of what you need to accomplish to earn an A"
67,,,"If he is participating in class or the group project, and making adjustments based on our feedback, he should expect an A with just fulfilling the basic requirements"
68,,,"Additionally, we will give extra credit opportunities, with eligibility described in a later section, to allow him to boost your grade"

76,,,"o Final code (that is clean and understandable), submitted in the assigned GitHub Classroom repository, and any other supporting documentation (e.g."
77,,,"README, code comments, etc.)"
78,,,"Documentation will be assessed based on how well a reader (without the aid of the original developers) can understand the implementation details, install any required dependencies, and execute your system"
79,,,It will be difficult to get an A if you do not have a tested working system

81,,,"design, final report) evaluated on its completeness (using given templates), and effectiveness in communicating key aspects of your system o High-quality recording of the final presentation with slide deck, evaluated on the clarity of communication and demonstration of your project’s system and development process"
82,,,These will be viewed by other students in the class and used as the basis for their end-of-semester reflections
83,,,● Condition of getting the project group grade is submission of all peer feedback and completion of all project deliverables by the deadline specified in Canvas
84,,,CSCE 310 Syllabus – Summer 2022 – Wade 7 | Page ● Final grades will not be released until all the project deliverables are verified by the instructor team

89,,,no workaround) o Our perception of your effort or contribution to the group project
90,,,This can be due to poor peer feedback (verified) [or] interactions with the teaching team
91,,,"o Continuously missing your group’s meetings, based on feedback from your fellow team members"
92,,,o Inappropriate (e.g.
93,,,"rude, not professional) communication with fellow students, instructor, teaching team"
