Additionally, we will give extra credit opportunities, with eligibility described in a later section, to allow him to boost your grade
Group Project You will work in a group to complete a project, through an application of an engineering approach to database design, development, validation, documentation, and end-of-semester class demonstration of the project experience &amp; solution
The focus will be on the final product, process, and teamwork
You will be assigned to a group of ~4-5 students
Rubrics are available for him to understand project expectations
● Project Deliverables –detail on the expectations of each one described in the project rubrics
Documentation will be assessed based on how well a reader (without the aid of the original developers) can understand the implementation details, install any required dependencies, and execute your system
It will be difficult to get an A if you do not have a tested working system
o Assigned documents (e.g.
design, final report) evaluated on its completeness (using given templates), and effectiveness in communicating key aspects of your system o High-quality recording of the final presentation with slide deck, evaluated on the clarity of communication and demonstration of your project’s system and development process
These will be viewed by other students in the class and used as the basis for their end-of-semester reflections
CSCE 310 Syllabus – Summer 2022 – Wade 7 | Page ● Final grades will not be released until all the project deliverables are verified by the instructor team
o Excellent peer feedback and contribution to the group project
o Effective (polite and collaborative) communication with fellow students, instructor, and teaching team
no workaround) o Our perception of your effort or contribution to the group project
rude, not professional) communication with fellow students, instructor, teaching team
Exams / Quizzes These will cover material from the homework, lectures, and any pre &amp; post lecture work (e.g.
It also informs him about gaps in his knowledge/skills needed to make a good grade
Any unauthorized sharing constitutes academic misconduct and will be reported to the honors council and result in the application of an appropriate sanction
Email submissions will not be accepted
 He is responsible to make sure that the assignment is submitted correctly
Double check your submission by downloading it yourself, then confirming that the one stored in CSCE 310 Syllabus – Summer 2022 – Wade 8 | Page Canvas is the intended one
This will allow us time to review his request and ask for additional information when needed
Extra Credit When needed to reinforce proficiency in concepts or boost his grade, extra credit assignments will be given throughout the semester, which are optional, hence you are not obligated to do these assignments
Depending on the complexity or time involved and quality of your submission, a maximum of 3% extra credit can be added to his final grade
